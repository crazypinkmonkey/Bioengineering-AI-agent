**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

Traditional preclinical models often fail to predict human responses, contributing to 90% clinical trial failure rates. This whitepaper presents an AI-driven organ-on-chip (OoC) platform that recapitulates human physiology with unprecedented fidelity, enabling accurate disease modeling, drug screening, and personalized medicine through multi-organ integration and real-time analytics.
