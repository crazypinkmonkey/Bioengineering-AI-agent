## Executive Summary

The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in metabolic health, with dysbiosis linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. This whitepaper presents an AI-driven approach to design personalized microbiome interventions that restore metabolic homeostasis through optimized microbial consortia, precision prebiotics, and targeted phage therapy.

### 1.2 Microbiome-Metabolism Axis
Key mechanisms:
- Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production
- Bile acid metabolism
