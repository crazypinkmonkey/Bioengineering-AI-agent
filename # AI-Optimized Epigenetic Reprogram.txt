## Executive Summary

Cellular reprogramming offers unprecedented potential for reversing age-related decline, but current approaches risk tumorigenesis and loss of cellular identity. This whitepaper presents an AI-driven platform that precisely controls epigenetic reprogramming factors to safely reverse biological age while maintaining tissue function and cellular identity, enabling a new paradigm in longevity medicine.
