**Author:** Parikshit Sarkar  
**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains the most significant obstacle in neurological drug development, with >98% of small molecules and nearly 100% of biologics failing to achieve therapeutic CNS concentrations. This whitepaper presents an AI-driven platform that designs and optimizes BBB-penetrant therapeutics with unprecedented precision, enabling effective treatment of neurological disorders from neurodegeneration to brain tumors.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The BBB Challenge
- **Current Failure Rate**: 99.6% clinical trial attrition for CNS drugs
- **Therapeutic Gap**: 90% of neurological diseases lack disease-modifying treatments
- **Economic Impact**: $1T+ annual cost of brain disorders globally

### 1.2 BBB Structure & Function
- **Cellular Components**:
  - Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs)
  - Astrocyte end-feet

  - Tight junctions (claudins, occludins)
  - Efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, MRP)
  - Metabolic enzymes
  - Immune surveillance
